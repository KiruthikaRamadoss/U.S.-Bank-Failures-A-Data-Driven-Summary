The Power BI dashboard reveals that 561–563 U.S. banks failed, with the sharpest collapse during the 2008–2012 financial crisis, especially in 2009–2010. Failures were heavily concentrated in Georgia, Florida, Illinois, and California, with Chicago and Atlanta identified as the hardest-hit cities. Seasonal patterns were also evident, with peaks in July (74), October (63), and March (60), highlighting both cyclical pressures and the legacy of the Great Recession.
